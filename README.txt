Embedded Systems Programming Lab 8

This program includes 2 timers, some buttons, and a couple seven segment displays. 

The first timer simply updates the seven segment displays every second with the amount of time that has passed in seconds. 

The second timer is a stopwatch. When a button is pressed the stopwatch starts, and when another button is pressed the stopwatch stops, and the elapsed time between pressed is displayed on the seven segment displays in miliseconds.
